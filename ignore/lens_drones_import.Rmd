```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Lens import record

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
lens_drones <- read_csv("data/lens_drones_2017.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(1:24)
```

Note that the data is noisy and that in raw the literature citations column is very noisy and needs to be removed from the raw, spilling rows need removing as do blank rows. Why so many blank columns are read in with read R is unclear and dropped with select above.
